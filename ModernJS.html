      How in the world do people keep track of all this stuff. Hopefully it' sless overwhelming in the real world. There are so many random things to use and download, node.js, npm, react, all the other frameworks, lodash, webpack, etc. I can't keep track of it all. Any tips? I have been running through the examples in the chapter but none of them are visual examples. You can look at my repo and see them if you want.<br>
