    <h1>Transform and Translate</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Translate takes two values, x and y as px</li>
        <li>Transforms don't work on inline tags.</li>
        <li>Scale takes two values as well. If you only provide one it will use the same value for both x and y</li>
        <li>transforms adjust from the center of the element, This can be changed with transform-origin.</li>
        <li>if doing two or more transforms, they have to be in one property, not two.</li>
        <li>rotate is another option. Declared with deg, radians,grad, or turns - use degrees. </li>
        <li>Transforms are executed in the same order they appear in the property.</li>
        <li>lastley is skew, which accepts two values x and y. if the second parameter is ommitted it will only apply the x axis.</li>
        <li>make sure you order your transforms in the right order, if you rotate first, the axis for the other ones changes as well.</li>
        <li>Transition properties should be declared on the defualt properties.</li>
        <li>Apparently 200 miliseconds is the ideal transition-duration.</li>
        <li>transition-timing-function allows you to adjust how the transition happens. To define your own, use cubic-bezier.</li>
        <li>There is a transition shorthand: property, duration, timing-function, and delay</li>
        <li>Animations allow you to create more intricate animatios by describing each key frame. DO this using the keyframes property.</li>
        <li>The animation property takes as its value a space-separated list of values for the longhand animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, and animation-play-state properties</li>
