    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>functions can receive long lists of arguments if they are declared with empty (). THey can then be placed in an array if you do this: (...args)</p>
    <p>Arrow Functions are much less verbose, but they lose many of their benefits if the function is longer than one line of code.</p>
    <p>function hoisting: JS will hoist your functions to the beggining of the script fie if they are defined with the function declaration. THis is great because we can group all functions to one place in the program and call them throughout the document.</p>
    <p>WHne a function accepts another functions as an argument this is called a callback</p>
    <p>map() is just like foreach() in that it iterates through an array, but the difference is that it returns a new array tha has the changes the user has applied to it</p>
    <p>I do not understand the reduce() function</p>
    <p>oh i get it. the reduce function iterates through the array. then the arrow function is what can do the variation.</p>
    <p> Filter() is great. Filter allows for the ability to well filter arrays.</p>
    <p>chaining iterators is a great way to transform data.</p>
