    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>In an array, you can delete the VALUE of one the value of an entry, but the position will remain. If it is called
        again it will return the value of undefined.</p>
    <p>Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an array and presenting them as individual
        values.<br>

        Destructuring allows us to assign multiple values at the same time, using arrays:
        "const [x,y] = [1,2];"</p>
    <p>This can be used to swap variables: "[x,y] = [y,x];"</p>
    <p>the length property is Mutable, changeable: "array.length = 8" is valid.</p>
    <p>pop() removes the last element. it will return the value and then remove it from the array.</p>
    <p> Shift() does the same thing but from the front.</p>
    <p>push() appends a new value to the end and then returns the new length of the array.</p>
    <p>unshift() is the same as push() but at the beginning.</p>
    <p>... is the spread operator and can concatenate two or more arrays into a new one. THe spread operator can also be
        used to flatten multidimensional arrays</p>
    <P>The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array,
        separated by commas or another deliminator if you put it in the ()</P><br>

    <h2>Sets</h2>
    <p> Sets are new, they are like an array but do not allow for duplicates. There is no literal notation to create a
        set as of now, so a set constructor must be used: "const list = new Set();"</p>
    <p>the add method must be used, again, no literal notation yet: "list.add(2).add(3).add(4);
        Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }"</p>
    <p> an easier way to do this is through the use of an array: "const numbers = new
        Set([1,2,3]);"</p>
    <p>sets have methods. Here are some: size(), has(), delte(), clear()</p>
    <p>spreads can be converted to an array with the spread operator. you can use the array.from() method as well.</p>
    <p>can create memory efficient non-primitive data type sets with the weakSet() constuctor. these allow for garbage
        collection (deleting references to removed arrays) while regualr sets do not. These do not accept primitive data
        types.</p><br>
