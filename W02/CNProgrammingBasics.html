    <p>The var statement is not used anymore. Let is the new standard. If it is defined within a block but not using the
        let keyword, it becomes a gloabl variable.</p>

    <p>
        If an object is assigned to a primitive variable (string, number, etc.) it will be assigned by reference rather
        than actually assigning a new value to the target variable. It also menas that if you change the valu eof one
        variable, it will change the value of the other as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Properties, objects, and methods both use dot notation, but methods end in ().

        Template literals are good. Use them.
