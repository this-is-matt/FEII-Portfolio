    <h1>Object Methods Article</h1>
    <a href="https://javascript.info/object-methods">Article</a>
    <p>Objects often are created to represent real world objects like users, orders, etc.</p>
    <p>let user = {<br>
        name: "John",<br>
        age: 30<br>
        };</p>
    <p>We can use functions to tell objects how to act. Functions tied to objects are called methods and are declared
        like this:<br>
        "objectName.functionName = function(){..."<br>
        we can also call a method like this: "objectName.FunctionName();"</p>
    <p>One can also declare methods through an object literal:</p>
    <p>
        user = {<br>
        sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"<br>
        alert("Hello");<br>
        }<br>
        };</p>
    <p>Generally THe object literal notation is preferred.</p>
    <h2>this.</h2>
    <p>"this." is used to access the object and it's variables, methods, etc.: "this.name"</p>
    <p> using "this" is more reliable than the alternative, which is to reference the out variable (object name)</p>
    <p>"this." can be used in unbound function(not-methods) and when called by a method definition or something else withing the object it will work properly. </p>
    <p>if a function is called that utilizes "this" outside of an object it will reference the global object(window in a browser). in strict mode it will throw an error.</p>
    <p>"this" acts differently in arrow functions. Do more research if you intend to use it. It references the outer object.</p>
    <p>More tasks in the article for more practice if you want.</p>
