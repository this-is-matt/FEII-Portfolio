    <h1>Objects</h1>
    <p>Object literals are a powerful way to declare an object without having to create a class. Objects are a great way
        to organize like functions or data.</p>
    <p>All objects are mutable(changeable at any time while the program is running, that includes it's objects and
        methods.</p>
    <p>I fthe key and value are exactly the same the property can be defined like: "const object{name, age}" instead of
        "const object{name: name, age, age}"</p>
    <p>can access properties through dot notation or brackets.</p>
    <p>Javascript encased in [] can be used to define either the jey or the value.</p>
    <p>The new symbol data type can be used as the key. I don't really understand how to use this. I need to learn more
        about the symbol data type. Also don't feel comfortable with the idea of defining new properties using the
        symbol data type.</p>
    <p>to check if an object has a property or method: "in": city in superman;, check if it returns undefined:
        supermna.city !== undefined;, or hasOwnProperty(): superman.hasOwnProperty('city');</p>
    <p>to log all properties or methods: "for(const key in superman){...}" in the function you would write log.console
    </p>
    <p>key, value, and entries methods are also helpful.</p>
    <p>Objects are not like arrays, so you shouldn't rely on an index to reference the properties. </p>
    <p>Properties can be delted like: "delete object.property"</p>
    <p>Nest objects using dot notation</p>
    <p>Objects are copied by reference. When you reference anothe variable it points to the same exact spot in the
        memory. It doesn't create a new one. </p>
    <p>Passing parameter in an object allow users to pass arguments in any order. This is great for functions that
        require many parameters. These are claled named parameters.
    </p>
<p>why would one wnat to use a string in a regexp? to me it doesnt make sense, at that point why dont we use c heckboxes, radio buttons, or a list?</p>>
