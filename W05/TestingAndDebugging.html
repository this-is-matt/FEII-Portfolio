    <h1>testing and debugging</h1>
    <p>
        Use strict mode in your JS because it make your code bettwer in every way.<br>
        Use a self invoking function to encapsulate code that is added to someone elses code to avoid throwing errors on
        someone elses code. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Linting</h2>
    <p>
        Linting tools highlight and expose poorly formatted and error filled code. <br>
        This helps to provide high quality code and to enforce style guides within a team.<br>
        Can get an extension for this or an online linting tool.<br>
        <br>
        New methods are often unsopported, put it in an if statement if(window.method){} returns undefined by the
        browser it won't cause an issue.<br>
        Modernizr and Can I Use are both libraries that help.<br>
        <br>
        Debugging can be used from the ide, and the browser.<br>
        <br>
        console.trace(); can be used to see all functions that were called.<br>

        <br>
        Debugger keyword is used to send the console information. It also provides a breakpoint.<br>
        <br>
        Throwing errors can be done with native error objects, but we can also use the throw statement to create our own
        errors. Throwing customized errors is more ideal than non-ideal responses like NaN as an output.<br>
        <br>
        Thrown errors terminate the program, which doesn't look too good. <br>
        <br>
        Try, Catch, Finally blocks are used to throw erros and handle them gracefully.<br>
        <br>
        Test Driven Development: write test first, then code:
        1.Write tests (that initially fail)<br>
        2.Write code to pass the tests<br>
        3.Refactor the code<br>
        4.Test refactored code<br>
        5.Write more tests for new features<br>
        <br>
       Testing Frameworks: <br>
        Jest, downloaded. cool syntax: test('square root of 4 is 2', () => {expect(squareRoot(4)).toBe(2);});<br>
        Could be used by any function to test.<br>
        if you navigate to the directory with the ______.test.js file in it and run "jest -c {}" in the termianl it will run the test script<br>
