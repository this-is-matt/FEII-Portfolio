   <h1>Modern JavaScript Development</h1>
   <p>
      I really struggled with this chapter. There are so many random things to use and download, node.js, npm, react, all the other frameworks, lodash, webpack, etc. I can't keep track of it all. <strong>Any tips?</strong> I have been running through the examples in the chapter but none of them are visual examples. Moost of them are in my repo though.<br>
      Things have gotten really convoluted with the Quiz-ninja project. I couldn't figure out how to get the webpack to work, so i think it's ready up to that point. And i am struggling to know how to fix the issue with the webpack. If you have any tips on how to learn all these different things or insight into how one interacts with these things in a real setting that would be good for me to hear.<br>
