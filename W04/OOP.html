    <h1>OOP</h1>

        i do not understand prototypes. to me it seem like if i am going to change a class, then i should change the
        class itself right? i guess if you can't access the original class? would i ever use the prototype for a class
        that i made or could change? <br>
        Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization, shared properties and methods.

        Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class declaration after it’s been defined can be added to the prototype. These will be added to all instances, even those that have already been created. Add any properties or methods that are individual to a particular instance can be augmented using assignment to that object (a mixin could be used to add multiple properties at once, as we’ll see later).
        Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor class needs to be reset.<br>
        i don't quite understand the child classes use of Super. "super(name)" is inside of a constructor function, so how is it calling the parent classes constructor function? also, do you call a constuctor function with just a name? i don't get it.<br>
