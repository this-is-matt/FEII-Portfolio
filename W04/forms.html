    <h1>Forms</h1>
    <p>
       A form can be submitted automatically with form.submit(). Or manually with a button, or an inout with a type attribute set to image. <br>
       form.reset, and attribute with type as reset will reset. automatically and manually respectively. <br>
       form.action can be set to send the form to a different URL.  <br>
       Are there any tricks to keep track of all the methods and other things in dot notation? It's really easy for me to get lost in those long strings.<br>
