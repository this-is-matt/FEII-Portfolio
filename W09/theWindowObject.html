    <h1>The Window Object</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>All JS environments have a global object and variables created are actually properties of that object. Functions = methods</li>
        <li>The BOM can be used to id the browser, screen size, and create pop-up windows</li>
        <li>THE BOM only makes sense in a browser environment, not in node.js or anything else.</li>
        <li>Can use the this. keyword if you don't know the global object.</li>
        <li>global variables are created without using let, var, or const</li>
        <li>can use window.location.href to see the full url, can also use this to redirect to another URL by assigning it a value</li>
        <li>.pathname returns just the path after the domain.</li>
        <li>windows.open creates a new window, however, not grat practice to utilize these.</li>
        <li>to create a cookiem use document.cookie ='name=[name]' This creates a cookie and assigns it a specific value.</li>
        <li>When should i use cookies vs. local storage and is there session data as well?</li>
        <li>window.setTimeout schedules a function, window.setInterval sets a recurring function. </li>
        <li>Can't use this. in these timing methods unless we are using this. to point to  the window object.</li>
